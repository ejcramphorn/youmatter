              my time to helping others and I have volunteered with many organisations
              over the past 6 years. I have campaigned on a nationwide level to improve
              awareness of mental health, have spoken at conferences, Primary Care Trust
              meetings, on educational resources and have helped to work toward improving
              services. I have also appeared on national and local television. In 2010
              I was awarded a b-eat award for my dedication to helping others with eating
              disorders. In 2011 I founded a youth support group with a local charity
              and was selected to carry the Olympic Torch, in 2012, for my contribution
              to the community. &nbsp;</p>

            <p class="text-justify">During my time at Imperial I have been involved in a variety of societies
              including co-founding Mentality, a hugely successful student led campaign
              promoting better mental health at Imperial. Last academic year we carried
              out both the largest ever student survey at Imperial and the largest mental
              health survey at any UK university, with over 1000 responses. Armed with
              this data we have already begun to elicit change on campus: counselling
              services have expanded, college tutor training is being revised and mental
              health is being talked about by staff and student bodies alike. However,
              there is a lot more work to be done and if appointed as Welfare Officer
              I will do my utmost to ensure that Mentality’s great work continues and
              that Imperial becomes a happier, more supportive community. Happy students
              are Successful students.</p>

            <p class="text-justify">I have struggled with my physical and mental health during my time at
              Imperial and have first hand experience of the current support systems
              in place. Personal experience gives me insight into where improvements
              are needed and where success needs celebrating. I have also taken an interruption
              of studies due to my health and have experienced associated problems of
              re-enrolment, cessation of student loans and isolation from friends, if
              elected as Welfare Officer I will work towards better support for students
              taking an interruption of studies and introducing more options for those
              with health problems: an interruption of studies should be a last resort.</p>

            <p class="text-justify">During my time at Imperial I have faced financial difficulties and have
              struggled to access appropriate support or advice. No student should be
              left without an income, confused about finance or unable to feed him or
              herself. If elected as Welfare Officer I will aim to increase access to
              emergency funds for all students. Additionally, I will arrange education
              sessions on changes to student finance and how they affect you as changes
              to student loans have been poorly explained, imposed greater stress and
              affect a large number of students.
              <br>
              <br>Imperial is a multicultural university and I have been lucky enough to
              experience this first hand. I have immersed myself in and learned about
              different cultures during my time here, enriching both my educational and
              social experiences. I believe that the heterogeneous student population
              at Imperial is one of the university’s greatest assets and thus if elected
              as welfare officer I will ensure that racism, sexism, homophobia and bullying
              of any kind is tackled.</p>

            <p>Additional policies include exploring the potential to join with other
              student unions to give our students a larger support network, lobbying
              college to accept documentation from and form affiliations with addition
              GP practices thus tackling the long ICHC wait times, providing consent,
              safe sex and substance abuse education, and introducing more welfare workshops,
              resources and stress less events. However, my principle policy is to listen
              to YOU and act upon student feedback. This is your welfare, have your say!</p>
